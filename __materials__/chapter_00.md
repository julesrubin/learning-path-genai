# Learning Practical Path

## Chapter 0 - You Said "Learning Path"?

This document explains the step-by-step learning path from Zero to Hero as a GenAI Engineer.

You've been given **your first real mission**. Don't be afraid, it is not real, but it is **realistic**. If you finish your journey, you will be completely able to deliver a wonderful mission for your next-to-come clients.

This learning path, as its name indicates, is a practical path to learn as much as possible in a short period of time. It will be intense but really fun as you will learn through a near-real context. This last point will be really valuable to be ready as a GenAI Engineer.

The project is huge, yes, but it will be split into smaller steps.

Each step will be composed of 3 parts.

### A Context

You will not work for nothing and for no reason. Everything will be related to a customer requirement, which is common in our job. This will help you understand how the GCP service you use fits a business requirement.

### Learning Resources

At each step, you will learn to use new services and concepts (Vertex AI, Gemini, RAG, ADK, MCP, etc.). **It is not a rush, take your time, go through every resource we provide**.

To be a really efficient GenAI Engineer, you always need to have theoretical knowledge of your tools. It will provide you a way to approach the pros and cons of every service for specific use cases.

Again, take your time to understand everything well and do not hesitate to complete this with other resources you find. During this journey, you will be asked to be more and more autonomous. But no worry, **your colleagues are the best of the best so you can always count on them**.

### A Mission

Learning by doing is the best approach to assimilate new stuff.

You will be guided in your mission. You can have objectives to complete (must have), objectives to improve your work (nice to have) and objectives to perfect your job (great to have). You are not forced to complete the nice and great to have. Enjoying your mission is what matters!

> We cannot repeat it enough, but take your time, do not hesitate to look for other resources on Google documentation, StackOverflow, and your colleagues.

### Final Words

This Learning Practical Path is focused on what a GenAI Engineer must know and do in their daily life.

There is no specific Professional Google Cloud certification for Generative AI yet, but this path will provide strong foundational knowledge. 
If you want to get certified, the closest certifications are: [Generative AI Leader](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/generative-ai-leader) and [Professional Machine Learning Engineer](https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/machine-learning-engineer).

Well done, you are ready to follow the instructions starting with [__materials__/chapter_01.md](__materials__/chapter_01.md)
